        body: "My strongest language is Python, where my experience breaks down into three main areas of use:
        <ul>
        <li>Machine Learning, comprising the scientific Python stack and numerous specific ML libraries. For more details, see the <i>specific technologies</i> subsection under Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Web development frameworks including Django and Flask</li>
        <li>CLI, ops, ETL and pipelining libraries such as Click and Luigi.</li>
        </ul>

      - subtitle: JavaScript and Web
        body: "I have been developing in JavaScript almost continuously since 2002, mostly in the area of web development. I keep myself up-to-date with modern JavaScript, including React, D3, and various UI, test and build frameworks. I also have considerable experience in HTML, CSS, modern web development standards, libraries and tooling. I also have some experience with server-side Node. I have a good understanding of principles of visual design, however my strongest design skill is knowing when the problem needs to be handed to a design specialist."
      - subtitle: Other Languages
        body: "I am also commercially proficient in Scala (mostly for ML projects), Ruby (mostly for test suites and dev tool configuration, but with some Rails experience), Perl (mostly around the Catalyst MVC framework) and Java (miscellaneous projects, but mostly around ML libraries). I also have a good working knowledge of R, Matlab, C#, C and PHP."

      - subtitle: Machine Learning
        body: I have commercial experience with a wide range of machine learning techniques, including: Hidden Markov Models, matrix factorisation, Gaussian Processes, kernel methods, and neural network architectures (particularly multilayer perceptron, LSTMs and autoencoders). I have also produced multiple commercial Natural Language Processing projects using statistical, linguistic, and information retrieval methods.
      - subtitle: Statistics
        body: I am experienced in a variety of regression techniques, from both a classical/frequentist and Bayesian perspective, including the GLM and hierarchical models. I also have commercial experience of factor analysis, a variety of time-series models, and use of GIS and spatial statistics, particularly around political geographies and census data.
      - subtitle: Specific Technologies
        body: "I have strong commercial experience using the Python scientific stack for common statistical and Machine Learning methods, including numpy, pandas, scipy and statsmodels. In the course of my work I've gained fluency with numerous Machine Learning libraries, including: spaCy, nltk and gensim for Natural Language processing, nimfa and pymf for matrix factorisation, OpenCV for computer vision tasks, PyMC for Bayesian modelling, and both TensorFlow and PyTorch for neural networks and other autodifferentiation techniques. I also have experience with Hadoop and Spark (both Scala and Python bindings) for distributed computing."
      - subtitle: Ancillary Skills
        body: "I have strong statistical and technical communication skills, and am able to express complex material for a wide range of audiences. I have strong data visualisation skills, and am adept at producing both written and presented reports.
